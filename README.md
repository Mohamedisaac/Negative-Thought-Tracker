### **How It Works**  

1. **Track Your Negative Thoughts**  
   Throughout the day, write down the negative thoughts your mind tells you will happen. For example:  
   - "Today’s meeting will go badly."  
   - "I’ll fail at my presentation."  
   - "Something bad will happen to my loved ones."  

2. **Mark What Actually Happened**  
   At the end of the day, review your list:  
   - If the event happened, mark it as **"True."**  
   - If it didn’t happen, mark it as **"False."**  

3. **Calculate Your Expectation Ratio**  
   The app automatically calculates the percentage of your negative expectations that actually came true. For example, if you had 3 negative thoughts and only 1 came true, your ratio is **33%**.  

4. **Track Your Progress Over Time**  
   Use the built-in progress chart to visualize how your negative expectation accuracy changes over days, weeks, or months. This helps you see patterns and recognize improvements in your thought process.

### **Why It Works**  

People with **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)** often believe:  
- "Only bad things happen to me."  
- "I always have bad luck."  
- "Every problem I think of actually happens."  

The **Expectation Ratio Exercise** helps you:  
- **Challenge Unrealistic Beliefs:** By comparing your negative thoughts to reality, you’ll see that not everything you worry about comes true.  
- **Reduce Overthinking:** Tracking your thoughts helps you externalize them, making them easier to manage.  
- **Build Confidence:** Over time, you’ll realize that your mind often exaggerates risks, which can help you feel more in control.

- **Easy to Use:** A simple, intuitive interface makes it easy to track thoughts and see results.
